      <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
      <p>A dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used. The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat. Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken. Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Beef</p>
      <p>Fatty cuts of beef have all of that delicious flavor and texture that sets it apart from other animal meat. These cuts have all of the tasty marbling that people come to expect with plenty of flavors. Keep in mind that these cuts tend to be more pricey and contain more saturated fat so they may not be the healthiest to eat all of the time. Lean cuts of beef provide a great ratio of protein to fat, with many cuts having low levels of saturated fat. Lean meat can be just as flavorful as fattier cuts, but it is healthier due to its lack of saturated fat.The reverse sear method involves searing the steak in a pan on a hot stovetop, then putting the steak into the oven and letting it cook until your desired rareness. Lock in the flavor.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Sushi</p>
      <p>Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, meat, fruits or vegetables. A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it is the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish. In fact, it is the word sashimi that refers to a piece of raw fish. When you eat sushi, you might eat cooked egg and rice, avocado and rice, or cooked fish and rice, as well as sushi made with raw fish and rice. Good sushi does not have one overpowering, dominant flavor. Everything should be balanced about it â€“ the feel and taste of the fish, the texture of the rice grains, the flavor of the seasonings. Sushi - delisious dish.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
